# 🔵 PHASE 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)

## Goal: Python proficiency for LLM testing

Java background helps, but Python patterns for AI/ML are different. Take time to internalize them.

---

### Week 1: Python Basics — Variables, Strings, Numbers

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
LLM testing is string manipulation at scale. Prompts are strings. Responses are strings. Everything flows through text.

**Learning Focus:**
- Variables and data types
- String creation, methods, slicing
- f-strings for prompt templates
- Type conversion
- **Bonus:** Basic functions & classes (just enough for project)

**Mini-Project: `prompt-formatter`**
```
Build a prompt template engine that:
├── Takes variables and inserts into templates
├── Validates inputs (not empty, within length)
├── Supports multiple template formats
└── Handles edge cases (special characters, unicode)
```

> **Note:** Week 1's project requires basic functions and classes (Week  3 concepts). The week includes `practice/02_functions_and_classes.py` to teach "just enough" before the project starts.

**Resources:**
- 🎯 Corey Schafer: Python Strings (YouTube)
- 📚 Python official docs: String methods

---

### Week 2: Data Structures — Lists, Dicts, Sets

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
Test cases are lists. Results are dictionaries. Unique values need sets. This is your daily bread.

**Learning Focus:**
- Lists: creation, methods, slicing, iteration
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs, nested structures
- Sets: unique values, set operations
- Tuples: immutable sequences
- **Bonus:** Basic functions intro (Day 3 - just enough for project)

**Mini-Project: `test-data-organizer` (Simplified)**
```
Build a test case organizer (single Python file):
├── Store test cases as list of dictionaries (in memory)
├── Add, search, filter test cases
├── Calculate statistics (pass rate, category breakdown)
└── Simple menu-driven interface

Note: JSON export/import moved to Week 5
      Package structure moved to Week 4
```

> **Improvement:** Unlike original plan, Week 2 now teaches basic functions on Day 3 before the project. No "surprise" prerequisites!

---

### Week 3: Control Flow & Functions

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
Functions are how you build reusable test utilities. Control flow handles the logic of evaluation.

**Learning Focus:**
- if/elif/else patterns
- for loops, while loops
- List comprehensions
- Function definition, arguments, return values
- *args, **kwargs

**Mini-Project: `llm-response-validator`**
```
Build validation functions:
├── validate_not_empty(response)
├── validate_max_length(response, limit)
├── validate_contains_keywords(response, keywords)
├── validate_json_format(response)
└── validate_no_pii(response)  # Basic patterns
```

---

### Week 4: Modules, Packages, Virtual Environments

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
Real projects have multiple files. You need to organize code properly and manage dependencies.

**Learning Focus:**
- Creating modules and packages
- `__init__.py` and imports
- Virtual environments (venv)
- pip and requirements.txt
- Project structure best practices

**Mini-Project: `llm-test-utils`**
```
Create a reusable package:
llm_test_utils/
├── __init__.py
├── validators.py      # From week 3
├── formatters.py      # From week 1
├── test_cases.py      # From week 2
├── helpers.py         # Common utilities
└── requirements.txt
```

---

### Week 5: File Handling & JSON

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
Test datasets are JSON/JSONL files. Results are saved as JSON. This is fundamental.

**Learning Focus:**
- Reading/writing text files
- JSON parsing and serialization
- JSONL (JSON Lines) format
- Error handling for file operations
- Path handling with pathlib

**Mini-Project: `dataset-loader`**
```
Build a dataset manager:
├── Load test cases from JSONL
├── Validate schema (required fields)
├── Handle malformed entries gracefully
├── Report statistics
├── Save results back to JSONL
└── Support for multiple dataset formats
```

---

### Week 6: Error Handling & Logging

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
LLM APIs fail. Responses are unexpected. Robust error handling is non-negotiable.

**Learning Focus:**
- try/except/finally patterns
- Custom exceptions
- Python logging module

---

### Week 8: pytest Advanced — Fixtures & Parametrization

**Why This Matters for AI Testing:**
Fixtures set up test data. Parametrization runs same test with different inputs. Essential for LLM testing.

**Learning Focus:**
- Fixtures: setup/teardown
- Fixture scopes (function, class, module, session)
- Parametrization with @pytest.mark.parametrize
- Conftest.py for shared fixtures

### Week 43: Production Monitoring — Observability

**Why This Matters:**
Testing doesn't stop at deployment. Production monitoring is ongoing testing.

**Learning Focus:**
- LangSmith for tracing
- Logging best practices
- Metrics to track in production
- Alerting strategies
- Debug workflows

**Mini-Project: `production-monitor`**
```
Build monitoring setup:
├── Integrate LangSmith tracing
├── Define key metrics
├── Set up dashboards
├── Create alerting rules
├── Debug workflow documentation
```

---

### Week 44: Drift Detection & Regression

**Why This Matters:**
LLMs change. Prompts drift. Catch regressions before users do.

**Learning Focus:**
- What is model/prompt drift?
- Baseline establishment
- Drift detection methods
- Automated regression testing
- Alert thresholds

**Mini-Project: `drift-detector`**
```
Build drift detection system:
├── Establish baseline metrics
├── Implement drift detection
├── Automate comparison
├── Generate drift reports
└── Integration with CI/CD
```

---

### Week 45: Performance & Cost Testing

**Why This Matters:**
LLMs are expensive and slow. Test and optimize both.

**Learning Focus:**
- Latency benchmarking
- Throughput testing
- Token usage optimization
- Cost tracking and budgeting
- Caching strategies

**Mini-Project: `perf-cost-tester`**
```
Build performance testing suite:
├── Latency benchmarking tool
├── Throughput tester
├── Token usage analyzer
├── Cost calculator
├── Caching effectiveness tester
└── Optimization recommendations
```

---

### Week 46: Human Evaluation Design

**Why This Matters:**
Automated metrics are proxies. Human evaluation is ground truth.

**Learning Focus:**
- When to use human evaluation
- Task design for annotators
- Inter-annotator agreement
- Combining human + automated
- Scaling human evaluation

**Mini-Project: `human-eval-framework`**
```
Design human evaluation system:
├── Create annotation guidelines
├── Build annotation interface (simple)
├── Calculate agreement metrics
├── Combine with automated scores
└── Document best practices
```

**🎯 Phase 4 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Understand agent architectures
